Leave the label off if you like the automated heading generated based on your heading title: for example, # Hello world = # Hello world {#hello-world}. To label an un-numbered heading, use: # Hello world {-#nice-label} or {# Hello world .unnumbered}. Next, reference the labeled heading anywhere in the text using \\@ref(nice-label); for example, please see Chapter 3. If you prefer text as the link instead of a numbered reference use: any text you want can go here. 3.2 Captioned figures and tables Figures and tables with captions can also be cross-referenced from elsewhere in your book using \\@ref(fig:chunk-label) and \\@ref(tab:chunk-label), respectively. See Figure 3.1. Figure 3.1: Here is a nice figure! Dont miss Table 3.1.

For example, we are using the bookdown package (Xie 2021) (check out the last code chunk in index.Rmd to see how this citation key was added) in this sample book, which was built on top of R Markdown and knitr (xie2015?) (this citation was added manually in an external file book.bib). Note that the .bib files need to be listed in the index.Rmd with the YAML bibliography key.

Here is a invovative way of including interactive rmarkdown files into my graduate CV to demostrate the skills I have throughout the scientific process through my training and previous experinence. 6.4 Rmarkdown Over the duration of my PhD I have developed a collection of scientific computing skills that lie within the scope of computational reproducibility. Coincidently, these tools are the same basic functionality to website development. For more information about simple R Markdown websites, please read the documentation at https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/rmarkdown-site.html. Please also note that simple R Markdown sites are not based on blogdown. They are probably good for websites with only a few Rmd documents. For larger-scale and more sophisticated websites (such as blogs), you may want to use blogdown instead: https://github.com/rstudio/blogdown. This is the base Jekyll theme combined with the html5 template here and build in rmarkdown through RStudio. 6.5 Jekyll You can find out more info about customizing your Jekyll theme, as well as basic Jekyll usage documentation at jekyllrb.com You can find the source code for Minima at GitHub: jekyll / minima You can find the source code for Jekyll at GitHub [jekyll-organization]: https://github.com/jekyll 6.6 Contact Twitter Facebook Instagram Email 6.7 Publishing HTML books can be published online, see: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/publishing.html 6.8 404 pages By default, users will be directed to a 404 page if they try to access a webpage that cannot be found. If youd like to customize your 404 page instead of using the default, you may add either a _404.Rmd or _404.md file to your project root and use code and/or Markdown syntax. 6.9 Metadata for sharing Bookdown HTML books will provide HTML metadata for social sharing on platforms like Twitter, Facebook, and LinkedIn, using information you provide in the index.Rmd YAML. To setup, set the url for your book and the path to your cover-image file. Your books title and description are also used. This gitbook uses the same social sharing data across all chapters in your book- all links shared will look the same. Specify your books source repository on GitHub using the edit key under the configuration options in the _output.yml file, which allows users to suggest an edit by linking to a chapters source file.
